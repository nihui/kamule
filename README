this software is still in early stage
hope my application won't eat your cat



how to use this application

you need a working aMule-daemon 2.3.1
version 2.3.1 is a must

run amuled as "amuled -e -o"
enter your ec password in amuled

launch kamule application, set up proper amuled host ip/port and ec password
host ip/port should be 127.0.0.1 and 4712 by default for a local amule daemon
click connect button first
click login button second

now kamule should work fine
